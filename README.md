# Lo-Chip-Emulator
A emulator for Lo-Chip (Loisel's Chip) written in Java

## About the Lo-Chip
Lo-Chip is my own developed 8-bit-virtual-machine. 
The main idea for this machine comes from the chip-8, 
but it has some major differences. 
<br>For a more detailed description of the Lo-Chip see
the 
[technical reference](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/loisel-dev/Lo-Chip-Emulator/blob/main/Lo-ChipSpecs.html).
As template for this I used the 
[technical reference for the chip-8](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
by Cowgod.

There is also a 
[assembler](https://github.com/loisel-dev/Lo-Chip-assembler) 
and a compiler for a lightweight programming language called
[clc](https://github.com/loisel-dev/Lo-Chip-clc-compiler)
in development.
